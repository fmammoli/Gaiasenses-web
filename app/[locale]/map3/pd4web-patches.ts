/**
 * pd4web-patches.ts
 *
 * Central registry of all Pd4Web patches used by the Gaiasenses map.
 *
 * --- How Pd4Web works in this project ---
 * Pd4Web compiles a Pure Data (.pd) patch to WebAssembly via Emscripten.
 * The build output lives under /public/<bundleFolder>/ and contains:
 *   - pd4web.js      — the Emscripten module loader (sets window.Pd4WebModule)
 *   - pd4web.wasm    — the compiled patch + libpd runtime
 *   - pd4web.data    — any embedded audio files / abstractions
 *
 * At runtime the loader script is injected into <body> as a <script> tag by
 * Pd4WebMapAudio. Once loaded it exposes window.Pd4WebModule(), a factory that
 * instantiates the Pd4Web class. Calling pd.init() starts the Web Audio context
 * and begins processing the patch.
 *
 * --- How to add a new patch ---
 * 1. Build the patch with Pd4Web and copy the output folder to /public/.
 * 2. Add an entry to MAP3_PD4WEB_PATCHES below.
 * 3. Set `activation.moments` to control when the patch is loaded:
 *      "map"    — active while the globe is visible (no composition playing)
 *      "player" — active while a visual composition is open
 *    Optionally restrict to specific compositions via `activation.compositions`.
 * 4. Set `binding` to describe what live data Pd4WebMapAudio should forward into
 *    the patch via pd.sendFloat(). Use "none" if the patch needs no live data.
 *
 * --- Receiver names ---
 * A "receiver" is a named inlet in the Pure Data patch (e.g. [receive x1]).
 * The names in the binding object must exactly match those declared in the .pd file.

 *
 * "none" — the patch manages its own audio without any live data input from
 *   the map. Use this for patches that only react to user gestures or BLE.
